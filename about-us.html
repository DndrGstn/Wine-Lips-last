            <p>
                It’s been one hell of a wild ride for us.
                Originally formed in Toronto back in 2015 as a part-time project between Cam Hilborn (vox, songwriter,
                guitar) and drummer extraordinaire Aurora Evans, Wine Lips quickly escalated into a full-blown,
                full-time, full-on international phenomenon. Their debut album took them across North America followed
                immediately by an intensive and unexpected tour of Hong Kong and China in 2018. They released their
                massive “Stressor” album the very next year (2019) to rave reviews and massive critical acclaim.
                Multiple tracks from Stressor charted across North American and European radio, while several songs
                ended up being featured in broadcast and Netflix series. Endless touring ensued.

                Then 2020 happened. The band used their mandatory downtime to fully dedicate themselves to crafting
                their groundbreaking third full-length “Mushroom Death Sex Bummer Party” (recorded by Simon Larochette
                at The Sugar Shack). The record was released in October 2021 and then shit really hit the fan. The
                international music press lost their collective minds, penning over 250 glowing features and super
                positive reviews spanning 35+ countries. At the time of writing, the album blew past 20 Million spins on
                Spotify alone. The vinyl release of MDSBP is currently in its 7th pressing with 9 different colour
                variants. The lead track “Eyes” has been licensed to a metric ton of films, series and video games
                including ABC’s The Rookie, Hockey Night In Canada and Population 11. Even more endless touring ensued,
                except this time the venues were huge and mostly sold-out.

                Which brings us to the new record… “Super Mega Ultra” is an absolute beast. Recorded by Simon Larochette
                at The Sugar Shack in Ontario, the album is jam-packed with 12 ramped-up supersonic ear-scorching
                auditory delicacies. SMU is probably Wine Lips’ most ambitious undertaking to date, exploring new
                thematic territory while firmly maintaining their signature psych garage punk rock panache. You truly
                need to hear the album to believe it… And if you haven’t already guessed, more endless touring is booked
                for 2024. The wild ride continues!
